## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TimeforWheelsParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/timeforwheels/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.timeforwheels.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Feature `delete`

The delete feature allows drivers to delete a delivery tasks from the delivery list by using the task number in the displayed list.

Implementation 
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact when a user enters delete 3 to delete a delivey tasks with task number 3 in the delivery list:


Description:
When the user keys in an input, execute method of LogicManager is called with the user input as the parameter.
In the method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input.
The DeliveryListParser parses the user input and identifies it as a DeleteCommand and instantiates a DeleteCommandParser object.
DeleteListParser then invokes the parse method of the DeleteCommandParser object to further parse the arguments provided.
In the parse method, the DeleteCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the input for the index of the item to be deleted.
If the index specified by the user is valid, a new DeleteCommand instance will be created and returned to LogicManager via DeleteListParser.
The LogicManager will then invoke the overridden execute method of the DeleteCommand object with Model as the argument.
Subsequently, the DeleteCommand object will invoke deleteItem method of Model with the index of the item to delete as the argument. It will then return a CommandResult object to LogicManager.
This CommandResult will be returned at the end by LogicManager.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the delete command:

![Delete Command Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteDeliveryTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

![Delete Command Activity Diagram](images/DeleteDeliveryTaskActivityDiagram.png)


### Find Feature `find KEYWORDS`

The find feature allows drivers to find a delivery based on attributes that match the keywords that have been typed in.

Implementation
The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact when a user enters find Alex to retrieve entries matching the word ALex in the delivery list:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is a further breakdown of the logic component of the find command using a sequence diagram

![Find Command Logic Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

Description:
When the user keys in an input, execute method of LogicManager is called with the user input as the parameter. In the
method, LogicManager calls on the parseCommand method of DeliveryListParser to parse the user input. The
DeliveryListParser parses the user input and identifies it as a FindCommand and instantiates a FindCommandParser object.
DeliveryistParser then invokes the parse method of the FindCommandParser object to further parse the arguments provided.
In the parse method, the FindCommandParser ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the keywords.
If the input specified by the user is valid, a new FindCommand instance will be created and returned to LogicManager via
DeliveryListParser. The LogicManager will then invoke the overridden execute method of the FindCommand object with Model
as the argument. Subsequently, the FindCommand object will take in the keywords and invoke the updateFilteredCustomersList method of Model that gets the
entries with attributes that match the keyword(s). It will then return a CommandResult object to LogicManager. This
CommandResult will be returned at the end by LogicManager.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the find command:

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**:
    - Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
    - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

2. **Reliability**:
    - Should be able to hold up to 1000 delivery entries and display all data if requested by the user in less than 5 seconds.
    - Should be able to detect and inform users of duplicate delivery entries.

3. **Security:**
    - Users that request for any delivery entry data to be deleted will have the data permanently erased from memory.

4. **Integrity**
    - For any time-related data presented to the user, the date formats will be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
    - Delivery entries made by the user will be stored in a _JSON_ file inside the hard disks.

5. **Flexibility**
    - TimeforWheels should be able to make it easy for users to find the delivery information stored inside such as name, date, address, tags etc.
